# Postdoctoral Researcher

Hi everyone! I am now a postdoctoral researcher in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at UC San Diego since October 2024. My current project is to enhance acoustic prediction capabilities of Comprehensive Analysis high-Dimensional Design Environment systems (CADDEE) based on Computational System Design Language (CSDL). This is supported by my PI, Prof. John T. Hwang. The research keywords are Multidisciplinary Design Optimization (MDO), aircraft design, and sensitivity analysis. I am also interested in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and aeroacoustics.
